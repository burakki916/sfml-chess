Currently not working at all, but I got a board rendering and you can highlight the squares.
***
Things needed to do : 
###
    # Figure out how the project is going to be set up
    # create piece logic and use a sprite sheet for the individual pieces
    # set up two-player online system
    # configure a system of menus to change various aspects of the game, but most importantly set it so where you can set the IP and port of the person you want to connect to
    # try to make it seem professional B) 
    # figure out how to work readme files as well
